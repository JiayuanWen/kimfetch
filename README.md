Normal neofetch or screenfetch script won't execute on Red Star OS due to multiple essencial commands, parameters, and the ability to define functions in script being removed from the distro. It is also not possible to install neofetch or screenfetch to begin with due to the lack of any conventional package manager. This script serves as a workaround.
