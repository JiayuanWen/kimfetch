Kimfetch recreates the look and function of [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch), the aim is to work around the issue where normal `neofetch` and `screenfetch` won't execute on Red Star OS due to essencial commands and parameters, as well as the ability to define functions in Shell scripts being missing or removed from the distros. 

## Install
Installation instructions can be found in the [[Wiki](https://github.com/JiayuanWen/kimfetch/wiki)].

* Red Star OS is developed by the DPRK, it is highly adviced not to install the system on your machine due to privacy risk and for personal safity. If you must use the OS, please install in a virtual environment with no access to internet granted.
