Normal neofetch or screenfetch script won't execute on Red Star OS due to multiple essencial commands and parameters, as well as the ability to define functions in scripts being removed from the distro. It is also not possible to install neofetch or screenfetch to begin with due to the lack of any conventional package manager pre-installed in the distro. This script serves as a workaround.

#### Warnings to devs:
* Since Red Star OS removed the ability to implement functions in custom scripts, please avoid using functions when modifying this script.
* Red Star OS is developed by the DPRK, it is highly adviced not to install the system on your machine due to privacy risk and for personal safity. If you must use the OS, please install in a virtual environment with no access to internet granted.
